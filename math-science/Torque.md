***Torque*** is the first derivative of [[Angular momentum]].
$$
\tau =
\frac{d}{dt}r \times p + r \times F
$$
Since the rate of change of radius is parallel to momentum, the first term vanishes. This yields
$$
\tau = r \times F
$$
Equivalently, torque is [[Angular acceleration]] scaled by [[Moment of inertia]].
$$
\tau = I\alpha
$$
