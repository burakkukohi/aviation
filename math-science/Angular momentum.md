Given a mass point traveling in a circular motion with radius $r$ (m) and momentum $p$ (kg $\cdot$ m/s), the ***angular momentum*** is defined to be the following vector (kg $\cdot$ m$^2$/s):
$$
L = r \times p
$$
with (2-)norm expressed as follows:
$$
\lVert L \rVert = \lVert r \rVert \lVert p \rVert \sin(\theta)
$$
where $\theta$ is the angle between $r$ and $p$.
