***Angular acceleration*** is the first derivative of [[Angular velocity]].
$$
\alpha = \frac{d}{dt}\frac{r \times v}{r^2} = 
\frac{1}{r^2}\left(\frac{d}{dt}r \times v + r \times a\right)
$$
Since the rate of change of radius is parallel to velocity, the first cross product vanishes. This yields
$$
\alpha = \frac{r \times a}{r^2}
$$
