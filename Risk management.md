During each flight, you need to make decisions that involve four fundamental risk elements: the <mark>pilot</mark>, the <mark>aircraft</mark>, the <mark>environment</mark>, and the <mark>type of operation</mark>. Tools include:
- [[PAVE]]
- [[5Ps]]
The risk management process continues as you evaluation the situation using these checklists at decision points during a flight.
