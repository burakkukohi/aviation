When you have time, i.e., not in an emergency, to recognize changes that occur, gather information, examine options, and assess risk, you use the [[ADM]] process to make an analytical decision. The ADM process consists of the following steps:
1. **Recognize a change.** Identify changes in your situation and be alert for sudden changes that can lead to abnormal and emergency situations.
2. **Define the problem.** Use experience and resources to determined the exact nature of the problem.
3. **Choose a course of action.** Consider the expected outcome of each possible action and assess the risk involved with each before making a decision.
4. **Implement your decision.** Take the necessary action to solve the problem.
5. **Evaluate the outcome.** Think ahead and keep track of the situation to ensure that your actions are producing the desired outcome.
Compare this with the [[DECIDE model]].
